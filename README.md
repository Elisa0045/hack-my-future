# Hack My Future

> A repository to help you organize your studying and notes, to get the most out of your learning during and after HYF.
> 1. Fork this repository and pin it to your github account. Besides your notes and study board, you can use the README of this repository as the home page for all of your projects on GitHub.  Very quickly your work will get buried and disorganized on your github account, keeping an organized list of all your projects can be helpful for review and for showing off your great work.
> 1. Clone it into the top level of wherever you store your notes and projects and set it up for organized note taking ...
>     * ... by topic.  Maybe you like to take your notes by subject, with a folder for all of your notes on JavaScript, one for Git, one for the debugger.
>     * ... by module. Perhaps you like to organize your notes with one folder per module, keeping track of what you have learned in the order you learned it.
>     * ... by project. Or do you like to organize the skills you learn by the project you were working on when you learned them>
>     * There is no wrong way to organize you notes as long as they help you learn.
> 1. Create a first project board called __learnables__.  Here's a suggestion for what columns to use:
>     1. .
>     1. .
>     1. .
>     1. .
> 1. Continue experimenting as you study, finding how this repository can best help you organize your learning. To reorganize it as time goes on, and to make whatever project boards, folders, issues or pull requests you find helpful.  This is your learning after all all!
